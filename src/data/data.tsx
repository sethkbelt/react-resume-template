        I am a student athlete competing in wrestling at GVSU while studying computer engineering. I chose computer
        engineering as my major because I most enjoy working in technologies where hardware and software interact. This means I
        get to touch a lot of aspects of embedded development in areas such as communication protocols, C development, FPGA, scripting
        languages, hardware bring up, and more. Recently, I have been expanding these skills to become a stronger developer with personal projects
        working with development boards, website building, and back end develoment for tools I am interested in.
